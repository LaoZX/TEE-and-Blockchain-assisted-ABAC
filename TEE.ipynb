    "\n",
    "In IoT environments:\n",
    "- devices are numerous\n",
    "- identities are dynamic\n",
    "- cross-domain access is common\n",
    "\n",
    "IBS requires:\n",
    "- tight coupling between identity and access rights\n",
    "- frequent key updates when permissions change\n",

    "ABAC decouples:\n",
    "- identity management\n",
    "- access policies\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows policies to evolve without reissuing identities or keys, significantly improving scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross-Domain Authorization Support\n",
    "\n",
    "IBS-based systems assume a single trusted Private Key Generator (PKG) or tightly coordinated PKGs across domains.\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "- PKG trust becomes a bottleneck\n",
    "- cross-domain trust establishment is complex\n",
    "- key escrow issues arise\n",
    "\n",
    "ABAC enables:\n",
    "- attribute verification across domains\n",

    "- blockchain-backed attribute provenance\n",

    "This aligns naturally with your cross-domain fog–blockchain architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "IBS introduces:\n",
    "- key escrow risk (PKG knows private keys)\n",
    "- heavy cryptographic operations (pairings)\n",
    "- complex revocation mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "ABAC:\n",
    "- uses standard public-key authentication for identity\n",
    "- assigns attributes independently\n",
    "- supports policy updates without rekeying\n",

    "IoT systems evolve:\n",
    "- devices change roles\n",
    "- policies change frequently\n",
    "- context changes dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "With IBS:\n",
    "- permission changes require identity-level changes\n",
    "- revocation is coarse-grained\n",

    "- operates on structured inputs\n",
    "- fits well inside TEE execution\n",

    "The ABAC mechanism is a flexible and scalable model that supports real-time and fine-gained access control. Prior studies have shown that ABAC is an optimal choice for IoT systems [][], since it can comprehensively accommodate IoT system's sophisticated environments,heterogeneous devices, and numerous dynamic access requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of ABAC is the concept of attributes, which describe entities, resources, and conditions involved in access requests. By customizing access policy over these attributes, ABAC is able to process numerous access requests from a large number of subject \n",
    "ABAC mechnaism is consisted of 4 fields:(subject attribute, object attribute, enviroment attribute and policy)\n",
    "1. **subject attribute** describes the entity requesting access, such as identity, role, department, and device capabilities, which indicate whether the entity is qualified to access target resource.\n",
    "2. **object attribute** describes the properties of resources, such as resource type, ownership, and sensitity level, which \n",
    "3. **environment attribute** describes contextual information that is independent of both subjects and objects, such as time, network state, or system workload. These attributes assist the policy to making context-aware authorization decisions.\n",
    "4. **policy** define the access standard based on the combination of above attributes, and will output a boolean value that 1 means permit and 0 means denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our proposed system, because the IoT device may be the resource provider and consumer at same time, so it may contain both subject and object attributes.\n",

    "Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger system that designed to maintain a shared and consistent record of transactions across a Peer-to-Peer(P2P) network. Compared to relying on centralized authorities, participants collectively validate uploaded transactions through consensus protocols to enhanse data integrity.\n",
    "A blockchian is constructed as an ordered sequence of blocks which contain a set of validated transcations. Each block's header cryptographicly stores the hash of pervious block, as shown in Fig, forming an chain structure. The attacker wishs to manipulate data stored on the blockchain would be required to recompute all subsequent blocks and control the majority of the participating nodes to achieve consensus. Such action is difficult and costly, thus blockchain can be utilized as a tamper-resistant and verifiable databased for proposed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In proposed system, since not all enetities are jointed to the blockchain, so we used a permissioned blockchain. Compared to the permissionless blockchain, which open to join for any enetities, a permissioned blockchain is constructed by authenticated participants. This approach also reduces consensus overhead and improves throughput.\n",

    "1. Fog node: They are (Fog Nodes Are Blockchain Validators / Peers, which Propose transactions (registration, revocation); Validate transactions from other fog nodes; Reach consensus on block ordering; Store replicated ledger copies) partially trusted, means they may be OS-level compromised or exist malicious insiders, but the Trusted Execution Environment on each fog node is assumed to be secure and provides hardware-enforced isolation. Fog nodes in each domain jointly maintain a blockchain and manage Iot devices in the domain. It deploys TEE and runs smart contracts in the enclave. It can be treated as a Attribute Authority in the ABAC system. It also store registered iots' info(attributes/access policies) securitly and back up those info to cloud.\n",
    "2. Iot node: They play the role of resource providers or consumers or both in the domain. Compared to the Fog node, IoT’s computing and storage capacity is relatively weaker and untrusted. It may ask access to other devices or resources inside or outside its own domain, which requires authorization from the blockchain maintained by Fog nodes.\n",
    "3. DDS: The cloud-based Dedicated Data Storage (DDS) acts as a trusted, robust backend storage service. Unlike traditional centralized authorization servers, the cloud/DDS does not participate in real-time authentication or authorization decisions. Instead, it provides durability, recoverability, and global availability for authorization-related data. In addition to serving as a trusted storage backend, the cloud can also act as a resource provider(application services, analytics, historical data, resources that IoT devices may want to access). Access to cloud-hosted resources is also authorized by fog nodes, while the cloud enforces access by verifying short-lived authorization tokens without participating in policy evaluation.\n",
    "4. blockchain: Serve as a global distributed ledger, the blockchain in this system carries the information of different domains which will be used for cross-domain authentication. The registered IoTs' identity information, as well as revoking information, will be stored on the blockchain for later authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Attribute Authority: a trust part of fog nodes, which is controlled by system manager or administrator. They contain the table of deviceID and corresponding attributes generated based on information provided by device manufacturers. Meanwhile, they also generate and maintain the access policies, which will be stored on-chain as smart contracts.\n",

    "Upon receiving the update message, the TEE verifies the AA’s signature and decrypts the content inside the enclave. The TEE assigns a new attribute version identifier and reseals the updated attributes before storing them outside the enclave in encrypted form. Old attribute versions are retained for a configurable period to support auditability and rollback if necessary.  \n",
    "To maintain global consistency, the fog node submits an attribute update transaction to the blockchain. The transaction contains only non-sensitive metadata, such as (UID, attribute_version, timestamp, Sign_TEE). The blockchain smart contract records this metadata immutably, enabling other system components to verify the freshness of attributes without accessing their contents.\n",

    "Revoke  \n",
    "revocation is necessary when a device becomes compromised, decommissioned, or no longer authorized to perform certain actions. In the proposed system, attribute revocation is enforced through version invalidation rather than physical deletion.  \n",
    "When revocation is triggered, the AA issues a signed revocation message specifying the target UID and the attributes to be revoked. The message is securely transmitted to the relevant fog node’s TEE. After verifying the revocation request, the TEE marks the affected attribute versions as invalid and updates the local attribute status.  \n",
    "A revocation transaction containing (UID, revoked_attribute_ids, timestamp, Sign_TEE) is then submitted to the blockchain. During authorization, the TEE checks the on-chain revocation status to ensure that revoked attributes are not used in policy evaluation. This approach prevents the reuse of stale or compromised attributes while maintaining an auditable record of revocation events.  \n"

We simulate the AN and the ON in a laptop with an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60 GHz and 16.0 GB of RAM which is installed windows 10 Professional 64-bit operating system. We use Intel SGX as the TEE in our experiments. Our version of Intel SGX SDK and Intel SGX PSW for is v2.10.100.2. We use C and the PBC library to complete the encryption and signature algorithm in our protocol, which allows the computation of bilinear pairs. The version of pbc library we use in our experiments is pbc-0.5.14. Since pbc is not a trusted library for intel SGX, which means it is not possible to call functions belong to the pbc library directly in the enclave, so we use the ECALL/OCALL interface to call external functions for our experiments. We chose the curve in type F parameter provided by the pbc library for our experiments which can provide the asymmetric bilinear pairs.\n",

The average transaction fee/cost is 23464 gas. The throughput of blockchain is 70 tps and the latency is 2.2 s. The blockNumber is 1577. The average block size is 801 byte and the average block time is 3.87 s. The reward per block is 0.293 ether and the hash rate is 33871."
